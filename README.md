# Modalyzer

Modalyzer is a tool for analyzing and gathering information from Minecraft mod files.

Currently, it supports the following methods of gathering metadata:

* mcmod.info files
* Forge @Mod annotations
* MCP mapping heuristics to determine sidedness/Minecraft version (requires MCP ZIPs to be downloaded manually)

For help, type "java -jar Modalyzer.jar help".
